[x] fix bug: faces missing on chunk boundaries
[x] do not output blocks for non-block blockIds (torches, flowers...)
[x] show progress on chunks x/y chunks processed
[ ] run processing and enclosedBlock fetching in separate goroutines
[ ] colors for all visible block types
[ ] store EnclosingSides instead of ChunkSides. That way when the chunk is processed, the side information can be discarded immediately
[ ] center on spawn point, not chunk (0,0)
[ ] make processBlock() return the data rather than calling the process methods itself. Rename current method.
[ ] add object that manages writing out the obj and mtl files
[ ] unit tests
[ ] godoc
[ ] refactor: introduce a 'preferences' type
[ ] refactor: tell the ntb file parser what it should extract and have it return that data (easy to pull out say, the spawn coords)
[ ] add version number and scripts to bump the version number
