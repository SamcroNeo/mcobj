[x] fix bug: faces missing on chunk boundaries
[x] do not output blocks for non-block blockIds (torches, flowers...)
[x] show progress on chunks x/y chunks processed
[x] run processing and enclosedBlock fetching in separate goroutines
[x] colors for all visible block types
[x] store EnclosingSides instead of ChunkSides. That way when the chunk is processed, the side information can be discarded immediately
[x] add object that manages writing out the obj and mtl files
[x] add version number and scripts to bump the version number
[ ] center on spawn point, not chunk (0,0)
[ ] make processBlock() return the data rather than calling the process methods itself. Rename current method.
[ ] unit tests
[ ] godoc
[ ] refactor: introduce a 'preferences' type
[ ] refactor: tell the ntb file parser what it should extract and have it return that data (easy to pull out say, the spawn coords)
[ ] add flag to output all water faces / blocks (deep water darker)
[ ] add flag to output all blocks (particularly for prt mode)

[ ] transparent blocks (torches, glass, redstone paths...) aren't part of the 'surface' and must include the blocks under them
[ ] write out txt file with mcobjBlockIds, blockIds, data values, and interpretation of those values IOT make it easy for prt users to create meshes
