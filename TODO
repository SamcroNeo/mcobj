 - Point Cloud file formats
    - xyz (emails: henryspam)

 - make processBlock() return the data rather than calling the process methods itself. Rename current method.
 - unit tests
 - godoc
 - refactor: introduce a 'preferences' type
 - refactor: tell the ntb file parser what it should extract and have it return that data (easy to pull out say, the spawn coords)
 - add flag to output all water faces / blocks (deep water darker)
 - add flag to output all blocks (particularly for prt mode)
 - transparent blocks (torches, glass, redstone paths...) aren't part of the 'surface' and must include the blocks under them
 - write out txt file with mcobjBlockIds, blockIds, data values, and interpretation of those values IOT make it easy for prt users to create meshes
 - 3DSMax .obj support
 - update build system to handle the three different platforms automatically
 - instead of showing 'cubes' for flat files (tracks, pressure plates, ...) change the face they sit on. (Same for buttons and torches on walls)
 - add FAQ (and try to make those questions not happen)
 - luxrender output
 - only write out the materials actually used
 - If no arguments supplied, read args from stdin
